## OKCM Baseline

The Online Knowledge Management System (OKMS) is a collaboration platform designed to support academic and scientific discussion, innovation, and inquiry. The targeted user group is academic and corporate researchers. As of the date of this proposal and planned testing period, the English version of OKMS is in the prototype stage.

## Test Objectives/Overall objectives for the study
The purpose of the study is to observe, collect, and analyze data on new English-speaking users of the OKCM platform to identify function and interface issues before the platform moves forward from the prototype stage. 

## Location and setup
Testing sessions will occur in a controlled setting and are not to exceed their proposed designated timeframe. The study will take place in private reserved rooms within the University of North Texas Willis Library facilities. Study moderators will observe from behind the study participant in as unobtrusive a manner as possible. Participants will use a Windows PC laptop and Tor Browser 6.5.1 with a high-speed Internet connection. The software Morae Recorder will be installed on the PC used by the study participants. While the test is being conducted, Morae Recorder will capture the testing process through a video capture recording of the screen as well as video of the user’s face through means of a pre-installed and attached web-camera. 

In the event the testing location within Willis Library becomes unavailable, a backup location has been selected. Testing can occur at the University of North Texas Discovery Park Information Research and Analysis Lab. A backup PC running Windows 10 and Internet Explorer 11.0 with Morae Recorder and a web camera will also be available in the event the primary PC becomes inoperable. 

## Recruiting participants

Participants will be selected from both graduate and undergraduate populations at the University of North Texas. Participants will be recruited in person at University of North Texas from a variety of different departments and disciplines, providing a representative sample of an academic institution’s population and potential OKMS users. Approximately five graduate and five undergraduates will be recruited to participate in this study. One graduate and one undergraduate student will be selected for our pilot study, and four graduate and four undergraduates will participate in the regular study.
